//
// Marks a *user* seek so the WASAPI exclusive bridge can tell it apart from the app moving the
// transport element on its own (a fresh blob URL for the same song, session restore, ...).
//
// Under exclusive output Chromium's transport clock is frozen, so the element's `seeked` events are
// the only channel a user seek has to reach the engine - but the app also fires `seeked` for its own
// resets, and mirroring those would restart playback. Every user-facing seek path calls
// `markUserSeek()` right before it moves the element; the bridge then knows the next `seeked` is real.
